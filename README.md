### A To-Do application built with a Django/Postgres backend and React frontend.

The goal of this project was to build an app similar to the previoud Keeper app but to also impliment a Postgres database.  
The style is more simplistic than the Keeper app but the application itself, was a bigger challenge.  Some of the key takeaways for me are:
1. Mapping whole components changed from something that *worked* to a concept that I now understand (and think is really interesting).
2. The tie-in between Django models and a non-built-in database that impliments full Create, Read, Update, & Delete (CRUD) oporations.
3. Asking for other peoples opinions (not associated with the project) on their style inputs, making adjustments accordingly and *"collaborating"* (in a sense) on the final product.
4. Deploying the application (to heroku) and using a remote database server - and how to use it locally.
